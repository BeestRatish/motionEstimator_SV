# motionEstimator_SV
The design goal is to use 14 nm technology to design a chip using ASIC implementation through Verilog to create a motion estimator. Through this, students will be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary for design engineering. 


The fundamental objective behind this project is Verifying the functionality and performance of a Motion Estimator design using System Verilog. The verification plan consists of creating a testbench based on System Verilog to verify if the Motion Estimator architecture is correct and efficient.
This project is a comprehensive endeavor, aiming to demonstrate the practical application of EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools in the verification of SystemVerilog digital designs. Emphasizing adherence to specifications and constraints, the project serves as a valuable tool for refining skills in Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) implementation.
Focused on the verification of a Motion Estimator, it leverages both theoretical principles and hands-on experience gained in Digital Design Verification coursework. Equipped with provided models for both design and testbench, students are tasked with applying their knowledge to ensure the correctness and functionality of the Motion Estimator.
The project is designed to align closely with the course goals and objectives, serving as a practical validation of the concepts covered. By engaging in collaborative work, students have the opportunity to explore various techniques and methodologies in digital design verification, ultimately contributing to the successful implementation of the Motion Estimator.
The ultimate goal behind this project is a foundational understanding of Verilog design. Through a combination of theoretical instruction and practical application, students create Verilog testbench files, enabling simulation results that showcase the correctness and functionality of the design. These results provide a comprehensive overview of the performance characteristics, offering crucial insights into the digital system's behavior.
